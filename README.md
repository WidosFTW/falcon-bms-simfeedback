Falcon BMS SimFeedback Provider



I have no idea, if this works properly and I am not going to test it (as I can't).

To use all channels or to adjust the max min ranges you might have to remove the effects and re-add them:

Available Channels:
Angles: Roll, Pitch, Yaw, AoA
Rates: RollRate, PitchRate, YawRate
Speed: IAS (km/h)

Just put everything in the SimFeedback folder and it should pop up by itself.

If you want to build it yourself, just open the .csproj inside of the Falcon folder with Visual Studio.
